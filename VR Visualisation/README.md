Virtual reality representation of a force-directed iterative layout, using [3d-force-graph-vr](https://github.com/vasturiano/3d-force-graph-vr). This component uses [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) for VR rendering and either [d3-force-3d](https://github.com/vasturiano/d3-force-3d) or [ngraph](https://github.com/anvaka/ngraph.forcelayout3d) for the layout physics engine.

Cycle through various topological data sets using the button on the top-right. Click the icon on the bottom-right to enter VR mode.

Simulate flying-style movement through the layout using a gamepad controller or the *arrow/wasd* keys on a physical keyboard.
