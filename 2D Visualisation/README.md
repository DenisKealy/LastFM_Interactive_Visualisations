This is a visualization of the top 500 songs ranked by Page Rank. Calculations were performed on 33,000 songs of which these had the highest Page Ranks. Node size is determined by: `pagerank*inDegree` so that the largest values display the largest nodes; This gives us the best representation of the most influential songs in the subset. Link width is proportional to the similarity rating between two nodes. Finally, the nodes are coloured according to community label as detected by our Label Propagation machine learning algorithm.


Playing with the visualisation:
- The user can select and manipulate one or multiple nodes.
- Hover over a node to see the artist & title.
- Zooming and panning is enabled using the mouse.
